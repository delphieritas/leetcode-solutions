# Q144 | Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree `{1,#,2,3}`,

```
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
```

return `[1,2,3]`.

**Note:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## writeup for this problem

Noted that this question is for preorder traversal the tree. So at first you should understand preorder traversal of the tree.

About traversal, detailed information has been explained here:
